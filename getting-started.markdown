## Logging on to Dataverse 

- Log in to **<https://dataverse.ucla.edu>** using your UCLA Logon ID. You’ll see a drop down menu where you can select UCLA.
- Create a **new “dataverse”** for collecting all your datasets in a single place. A **dataverse** is a container for collecting multiple datasets or studies. Think of it as a *vita* for your datasets.
- Add a **dataset** that can include multiple files such as data files, code and supplementary materials.
-  To help others discover and understand the data, provide some information about what you’ve uploaded in the forms provided.
-  Select save and then publish. Or, if you would like to restrict access to the data, you can share only with a select few.
