## What is UCLA Dataverse  

Dataverse is an open source software platform for sharing, finding, citing, and preserving research data (developed by the Data Science and Products team at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (Harvard) and the Dataverse community).
dataverse.org is our home on the web and shows a map of Dataverse installations around the world, a list of features, integrations that have been made possible through REST APIs, our development roadmap, and more.
